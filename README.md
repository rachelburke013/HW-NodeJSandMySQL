Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront app. The app takes in orders from customers, processes transactions and adjusts the store's local inventory. 

The customer is given a table of products to choose from. Each product contains a unique Item ID number, product name, department name, price, and the product's availability in stock.

To initiate the transaction, the customer is given a prompt asking for the ID Number of the product they would like to buy. This is followed by an additional prompt asking how many units of product they would like to purchase. 

Once the customer has placed the order, the application determines if there is ample inventory to process the transaction. If yes, the application fulfills the customers order. If no, the application asks the customer to choose a different quantity of product and try the transaction again. The customer is then shown the total cost of their purchase and the SQL database is updated to reflect the remaining inventory.
